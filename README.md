# 🔍 Penetration Testing as a Service (PTaaS)

## 🚀 Automating Penetration Testing using Reinforcement Learning  


---

## 📖 Overview  
**Penetration Testing as a Service (PTaaS)** is an **automated cybersecurity solution** that utilizes **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** to conduct penetration testing. Traditional penetration testing methods require **manual effort**, are **time-consuming**, and **depend on cybersecurity professionals**.  

This project **automates penetration testing** using **machine learning** and **AI-driven security assessments** to improve efficiency, accuracy, and scalability.  

### 🔹 Features  
✅ **Automated scanning & exploit testing**  
✅ **AI-based attack strategy learning** (Reinforcement Learning - Q-Learning)  
✅ **Real-time vulnerability detection & reporting**  
✅ **Integration with penetration testing tools** (**Nmap, Metasploit**)  
✅ **Web-based interface with Flask & Python**

## 🎯 Objectives  
✔ **Automate penetration testing** – Reduce manual effort  
✔ **Improve scalability** – Adapt to complex networks  
✔ **Enhance accuracy** – Dynamic attack path optimization  
✔ **Generate actionable reports** – Provide security insights  
✔ **Seamless tool integration** – Works with Nmap & Metasploit

## 🏗️ System Architecture  
1️⃣ **Network Scanning**: Identifies open ports, services, and OS details using **Nmap**  
2️⃣ **Vulnerability Analysis**: Detects security weaknesses using **OpenVAS, SQL Injection, XSS scanning**  
3️⃣ **Exploitation Framework**: Uses **Metasploit** to simulate real-world attacks  
4️⃣ **Reinforcement Learning Module**: Learns optimal attack strategies dynamically  
5️⃣ **Automated Reporting**: Generates insights on security risks and mitigation strategies
