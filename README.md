# 🔍 Penetration Testing as a Service (PTaaS)

## 🚀 Automating Penetration Testing using Reinforcement Learning  


---

## 📖 Overview  
**Penetration Testing as a Service (PTaaS)** is an **automated cybersecurity solution** that utilizes **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** to conduct penetration testing. Traditional penetration testing methods require **manual effort**, are **time-consuming**, and **depend on cybersecurity professionals**.  

This project **automates penetration testing** using **machine learning** and **AI-driven security assessments** to improve efficiency, accuracy, and scalability.  

### 🔹 Features  
✅ **Automated scanning & exploit testing**  
✅ **AI-based attack strategy learning** (Reinforcement Learning - Q-Learning)  
✅ **Real-time vulnerability detection & reporting**  
✅ **Integration with penetration testing tools** (**Nmap, Metasploit**)  
✅ **Web-based interface with Flask & Python**  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
✔ **Automate penetration testing** – Reduce manual effort  
✔ **Improve scalability** – Adapt to complex networks  
✔ **Enhance accuracy** – Dynamic attack path optimization  
✔ **Generate actionable reports** – Provide security insights  
✔ **Seamless tool integration** – Works with Nmap & Metasploit

## 🏗️ System Architecture  
1️⃣ **Network Scanning**: Identifies open ports, services, and OS details using **Nmap**  
2️⃣ **Vulnerability Analysis**: Detects security weaknesses using **OpenVAS, SQL Injection, XSS scanning**  
3️⃣ **Exploitation Framework**: Uses **Metasploit** to simulate real-world attacks  
4️⃣ **Reinforcement Learning Module**: Learns optimal attack strategies dynamically  
5️⃣ **Automated Reporting**: Generates insights on security risks and mitigation strategies

## 🚀 Installation & Setup  

### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PTaaS.git
cd PTaaS


### **Step 2:  Set up a Virtual Environment**
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows


### **Step 3:Install Dependencies**
pip install -r requirements.txt


### **Step 4:Install Required Security Tools**

 Nmap (for network scanning)
 sudo apt install nmap  # Linux
 brew install nmap      # macOS

 Metasploit (for exploit testing)
 curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/master/msfupdate | bash

 OpenVAS (for vulnerability scanning)
 sudo apt install openvas

### **Step 5:  Set up the Environment File (.env)**
Create a .env file in the project root and add your OpenAI API key (if using AI-based insights).

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

### **Step 6:  Run the Flask App**
python app.py


### **Step 7: Access the Web Interface**
Open http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser
Enter a target URL and start scanning
